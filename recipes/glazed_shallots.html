    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>
      These shallots turn out soft and sweet, with a delicious umami background
      from the chicken stock and a slight tang from the wine. And they play
      perfectly with that roast turkey.
    </p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>1¼ pounds (about 36) small shallots, peeled</li>
      <li>½ cup white wine</li>
      <li>1 cup homemade or low-sodium chicken stock</li>
      <li>1 tablespoon granulated sugar</li>
      <li>1 teaspoon kosher salt</li>
      <li>3 tablespoons unsalted butter</li>
      <li>A few grinds of black pepper</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
      <li>
        In a skillet just large enough to hold the shallots in a single layer,
        combine the shallots, wine, stock, sugar, salt and 2 tablespoons of the
        butter. Place over high heat, bring to a boil, lower to a simmer and
        cook, uncovered, until the liquid evaporates and the shallots are very
        tender, about 10 to 15 minutes.
      </li>
      <li>
        Raise heat to medium high and cook, shaking the pan frequently, until
        the shallots begin to brown and are coated with a thick syrup. Remove
        from heat and add the final tablespoon of butter, shaking the pan until
        it is melted and incorporated. Serve immediately.
